                            You must follow any policies made available to you within the OPENS homepage.

                            The OPENS homepage displays some content that is not owned by DRM inside. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. DRM inside may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and DRM inside may remove or refuse to display content that DRM inside reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that DRM inside reviews the content, so please don’t assume that DRM inside does.

                        <span>We provide the OPENS homepage using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about the OPENS homepage.
                        Other than as expressly set out in these conditions or additional conditions, neither DRM inside nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the OPENS homepage. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the content within the OPENS homepage, the specific functions of the OPENS homepage, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs. We provide the OPENS homepage service “as is”.
                        Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties..</span>

                        <span class="txt_tit">Liability for services provided by the OPENS homepage</span>
                        <span>When permitted by law, DRM inside, and DRM inside’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.
                        To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of DRM inside, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these conditions, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the OPENS homepage (or, if we choose, to supplying you the OPENS homepage again).
                        In all cases, DRM inside, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
                        We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a consumer. If you are using the OPENS homepage for a personal purpose, then nothing in these conditions or any additional conditions limits any consumer legal rights which may not be waived by contract.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="txt_tit">About these Conditions</span>
                        <span>We may modify these conditions or any additional conditions that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the OPENS homepage. You should look at the conditions regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these conditions on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional conditions in the OPENS homepage. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified conditions for the OPENS homepage, you should discontinue your use of the OPENS homepage.
                        If there is a conflict between these conditions and the additional conditions, the additional conditions will control for that conflict.
                        These conditions control the relationship between DRM inside and you. They do not create any third-party beneficiary rights. If you do not comply with these conditions, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular condition is not enforceable, this will not affect any other conditions.
                        The courts in some countries will not apply Republic of Korea law to some types of disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where Republic of Korea law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such disputes related to these conditions. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of Republic of Korea, excluding Republic of Korea’s choice of law rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these conditions or the OPENS homepage. Similarly, if the courts in your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Republic of Korea, then your local jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these conditions. Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these conditions or the services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Republic of Korea, and you and DRM inside consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
