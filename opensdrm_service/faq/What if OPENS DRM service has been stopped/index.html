    <ul>
        <li>If you adopt ISO TS 23078-2 type (Readium LCP), service stop would not matter. Because any Readium LCP compliant application will open the existing purchased eBook as long as passphrase is provided.</li>
        <li>If you adopt ISO TS 23078-3 type (Device based protection) and service stops, copying to new device does not allowed any more.</li>
