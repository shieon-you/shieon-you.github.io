    <ul>
        <li>If your publishers do not want their eBooks to be copied to unauthorized other device, we recommend you to choose ISO TS 23078-3 (Device based protection). Disadvantage of this type is to require internet connection when it copies to other device.</li>
        <li>If your publishers allow user convenience so that their eBooks to be copied into his other device with passphrase, choose ISO TS 23078-2 (Readium LCP). It does not require any internet connection to copy other device.</li>
